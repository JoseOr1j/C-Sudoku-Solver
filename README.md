# C++ Sudoku-Solver
Console application that solves games of sudoku with speedy succession

A C++ program to play a Sudoku game and show its winning result. This is a console application program of using multi-dimensional arrays on a 9x9 board. This program plays a Sudoku game and completes the game with a winning result, if the game is unsolvable then the program loops to another pre-written game, if none are solveable the program thanks the user and terminates.

## Getting Started

Download file and extract zip files.

### Prerequisites

Any IDE that can run C++ code. Most IDEs work, or you can also use an online IDE such as Repl.it (https://repl.it/languages) 
and go to *C++*

### Installing

Download [fork] the zip file and extract. 
Once extracted the main.cpp file should appear with the source code. 

## Deployment

Open the source file main.cpp (or in this case the Sudoku.cpp) onto any IDE with C++ support.

Edit:

```
Or you can copy and paste the code directly from github (working on a live version).
```

## Built With

* [C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) - Language(s)
* [Microsoft Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) - IDE

## Summary

I learned a lot about the complexities of C++ code and how it can get very hectic on massive codebases. This project itself contained, functions, loops, multi-dimensional arrays, return statements, and a recursive algorithm needed to solve. This project was made before I was introduced to Object Oriented Programming, which would have made the process of this console application to go much smoother.
